# Pokemon Player
Pokemon Player is a personality test. It gives a questionnaire, complies the results, then provides their Pokemon Player.

## Project Details
The personality test was an exercise in *App Development with Swift* offered on iBooks.

The app's home screen opens up to the questionnaire, where there are different question screens for different answer types. After completing the questionnaire, you will be provided with your 'Pokemon character'.

### Summary
I really enjoyed putting this app together. My nephew, who is a big Pokemon admirer thought it was cool! It didn't keep his interest but it gave us something to talk about.

Thanks for checking this out!
